Feature: Orchestration

  What a pass is, when it ends, and when the factory stops. These
  rules do not care how validation is done.

  Background:
    Given a copy of the factory, in a folder of its own inside a new codebase
    And a seed describing a game of Tetris
    And the agent is the ralph-alpha-beta stand-in

  Rule: The factory works in the codebase around it

    The factory sits in a folder of its own inside the codebase it builds,
    and builds in the folder around it. The codebase is a git repository;
    the factory commits its work there, and leaves its own folder out of
    those commits.

    A new codebase, for an example, is a new git repository with a copy
    of the factory in it. That is how an example keeps out of the codebase
    you are building.

  Rule: Each pass does one task, then stops

    Example: Three tasks remain
      Given a plan with three tasks, none of them done
      When the factory runs one pass
      Then the plan shows the first task as done
      And the plan shows the other two as not done
      And the factory has stopped

  Rule: The factory commits after every pass that does a task

    Example: One pass, one commit
      Given a plan with three tasks, none of them done
      When the factory runs one pass
      Then there is one new commit
      And it contains the work for the first task

    Example: Finished work is not redone
      Given a plan whose first task is done
      When the factory runs one pass
      Then there is one new commit
      And it contains the work for the second task

  Rule: The factory stops when the agent says the plan is complete

    The agent keeps the plan, so only the agent knows when it is
    complete. It says so by answering PLAN COMPLETE.

    Example: Work remains
      Given a plan with three tasks, none of them done
      When the factory runs to completion
      Then the plan shows every task as done
      And there are three new commits
      And the factory has stopped

    Example: Every task is already done
      Given a plan in which every task is done
      When the factory runs to completion
      Then the agent has been called once
      And there are no new commits
      And the factory has stopped
