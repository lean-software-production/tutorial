# Homework 4, part 2 — Steering

*Do this after part 1.*

Read `FACTORY.md`, then the feature files in `features/`.

You can see what the machines are doing. Now you can answer them. While a
machine is working you can send it a message, and it picks the message up
at its next step — the way you interrupt an agent mid-task, not the way
you edit its prompt.

Two things make this harder than it sounds. More than one machine runs at
once during fan out, so a message names the machine it is for. And a
message is for a machine that is working now: if the machine you name has
finished, or has not started, the factory tells you so rather than holding
your message for whoever comes next.

A message lives in that machine's run and dies with it. If you want
something to stick, it belongs in the seed, the plan, or the machine's own
prompt. Noticing where the difference bites is most of the point of this
homework.

## The commands you'll end up with

On top of part 1's, one more — again, the exact shape is yours:

```sh
$ ./factory say tetris doer "use curses, not print"
delivered to doer

$ ./factory say tetris reviewer-1 "be strict about error handling"
refused: doer is what is running
```
